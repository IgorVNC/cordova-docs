        At his day job he works on a Cordova app that became very complex over years. Contributes to Apache and develops plugins mostly in his free time.
        Started contributing patches and became active in Cordova development after hitting the limits and finding OS bugs. 
        Niklas mostly worked on the InAppBrowser plugin and cordova-ios but tries to help everywhere he can.
